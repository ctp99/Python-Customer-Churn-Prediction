# Python-Customer-Churn-Prediction

In this project, I build a machine learning model with TensorFlow to predict whether a customer was going to end their subscription at the end of the year. The dataset consists of over 7000 entries, and it has numerous columns that are used as variables in the model that help the machine predict outcomes. The model is about 80% accurate at predicting whether someone will keep or end their subscription.
